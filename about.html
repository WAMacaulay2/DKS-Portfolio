		<div id="bio-text">
			<p>Hi. I'm Alex Macaulay. I'm a programmer and Computer Science graduate who's dabbled in game development, as this website shows.</p>
			<p>I started programming as a teen when I learned that it was possible for one person to make video games if they just had the right tools and knowledge. I taught myself C++ and created a simple three-level platformer game.</p>
			<p>Around the time I finished that game, I started college and, due to my head start in the subject, opted to go for a Bachelor's in Computer Science. During college, I was the leader of two student software projects, both of which earned A's.</p>
			<p>Following college, I used my game development skills to finish and release two games on Android. However, competing in the Google Play store's oversaturated marketplace proved to be more trouble than it was worth, and I realized I had grown out of my ambition to be a game developer. One of my games did achieve 1,000+ downloads, though, so that was neat (the other one... did not make those numbers).</p>
			<p>Currently, I'm seeking work in web development, as it looks like an interesting and challenging field and I've found I like making web pages that look neat. This website was made to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and also doubles as a portfolio of most of my most notable accomplishments, computer-wise.</p>
			<p>For resume and contact info, <a id="linkedIn-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-macaulay-9990a7159/" target="_blank">see my linkedIn profile.</a></p>
			<p>P.S. Even though I've moved on from game development, I'm still pursuing a more creative hobby. I've taken up fiction writing, as when I came up with game ideas, I usually found that the characters and stories were more interesting than the game part.</p>
