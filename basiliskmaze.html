			<h2>App Store Description</h2>
			<p>He’s the thing of nightmares to all creatures of the Fairy Lands: the Basilisk, a colossal beast with a paralyzing gaze and jaws big enough to gobble up a dragon whole! He makes his home deep inside a maze of ancient catacombs, hoarding wealth stolen from his scores of unfortunate victims. Many foolhardy adventurers have ventured into this lair, hoping to take a small piece of his riches for themselves, but few ever come back to tell the tale. Will you be one of the lucky ones?</p>
			<p>The Basilisk’s Maze is a simple, spooky arcade game where you take control of a denizen of a fairy tale land and enter a randomly-generated maze looking for gold, while a monster lurks in the shadows waiting to eat you. You must avoid this beast at all costs! Don't even let him see you, as his gaze can slow you down and make you an easy meal! Evade the monster and grab his treasure, but watch out! Some of it is haunted by ghosts that don't take kindly to being stepped on!</p>
			<p>If you can overcome all these dangers, you'll escape with a hoard of gold, a story to tell, and most importantly, your life! And if your adventure is particularly prosperous, you may attract a few other brave (or stupid) creatures who'd be willing to let you make them a fortune as well!</p>

			<h2>Behind the Scenes...</h2>
			<p>I began work on The Basilisk's Maze as I was wrapping up work on Food Chain. I got the idea after hearing about an old game called "3D Monster Maze," where one had to escape a maze while avoiding a T-Rex that chased you. I liked it for being another simple concept like Food Chain, and thought it would make for another good arcade-like game if I added a little bit extra, such as treasure to collect for a score. Though I hadn't intended it, it also made for a weird symmetry between the two games, where in the first game you were the predator, and in this one you were the prey.</p>
			<p>For the villain, I used a monster I'd been planning to make the bad guy of a larger game, intending this small game to be a sort-of prequel. Set in a fairy-tale world, I planned to have a multitude of fantasy creatures you could unlock as playable characters, some secrets to discover, and even a second monster that would help the first.</p>
			<p>However, the game proved to be more draining to work on than I anticipated. Having to make the artwork myself proved time-consuming, as did animating all the menus. Even if they did look nice in the end, I realized I'd burn myself out trying to create all the assets I originally planned.</p>
			<p>Not helping matters was having to adapt to a new, more complex development environment, since my old one had a major update that introduced so many new bugs it became unusable. On top of all that, I was disappointed to find that the core gameplay grew dull a lot faster than Food Chain's, and reworking it would require a complete overhaul of the project. It looked a lot nicer than Food Chain, at least.</p>
			<p>I ended up cutting the game down to its bare essentials and only keeping a handful of the unlockable characters (which were unlocked through achieving high scores rather than the planned in-app purchases). With the reduced scope, I was able to finish the game and get it out on the app store.</p>
			<p>To this day, The Basilisk's Maze has gotten next to no traffic, thanks to the oversaturated Google Play store; there just isn't any space for it to be seen. With how much time and effort such a small game had taken, only to be met with silence, I reexamined my goals as a developer and came to the decision that my effort would be better spent in a different field. Besides, I couldn't think of any game ideas good enough that I could honestly say I'd be willing to dedicate years of my life realizing.</p>
			<p>Perhaps one day I'll return to game development, but if I did, it would need a solid, original idea that wouldn't grow boring fast. It would also probably be with a team of people rather than by myself, so that way there's more people who can bear the burden with me.</p>
			<p>Though Food Chain did get downloaded 1,000+ times. Maybe a sequel someday wouldn't be a bad idea...</p>
